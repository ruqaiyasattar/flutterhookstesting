# testinghook

A Flutter Hook project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter hooks application.

Flutter hooks as an alternative to stateful widget, Its is a community package. 
With stateful widgets, we saw that we needed two classes, one for the widget and the other for the state. We needed to define the mutable properties of the widget in the state class and then use setState to mutate them and trigger a rebuild.

Hooks give us the means:

Reduce redundant and cumbersome boilerplate code such as that in a stateful widget
Improve on our code usability as we can create and reuse hooks without any issues.
